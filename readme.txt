1. In-Place Algorithm
-- Transforms the input without using any extra memory. As the algorithm executes, 
-- the input is usually overwritten by the output, and no additional space is needed for this operation.

2. Out of Place Algorithm
-- Transforms the input by using extra memory.
-- Useful when a you need a helper

3. Sorting Algorithms: Takes in a unsorted list
-- Bubble Sort
-- Insertion Sort
-- Merge Sort

4. Binary Search Algorithm
-- Only use on a sorted list to find a specific target value
